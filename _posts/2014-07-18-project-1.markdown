description: I attended <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003">Udacity's iOS Nanodegree Course</a> to learn programming iOS, which is known for providing high quality vocational programs=. While attending the course, I was able to learn basic iOS programming techniques, such as Autolayout, Swift programming syntax, UIKit and Core Data, etc. In order to pass the course, I had to create a portfolio of five apps based on what I had learned. Among them, four apps are related to course contents and the other app, which is a final capstone project, is solely developed by myself. One of the best parts of the course is that my source code was fully reviewed by experts via Github account. I was able to get valuable advices about design decisions, programming style, and debugging. I think this course laid a good foundation for me to become a iOS developer.
